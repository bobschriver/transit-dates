### Transit Dates

The purpose of this project is to leverage simple blogging provided by Jekyll and Markdown, as well as controlled revisions through git to provide a semi-user editable compilation of trips. 
The posts are designed to be as user friendly as possible, requiring no HTML knowledge to create. All HTML is generated on the fly through Jekyll and Liquid templating. A user could create a post, file a pull request, and then be integrated into the main blog. 
The main concerns with this project were simple hosting/maintenence and ease of user editing and submission.
